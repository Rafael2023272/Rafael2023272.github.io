                    There was a time when destroying army camps would destroy troops. A time where you could sell buildings too. Over my many years of playing this game. 
                    I have to say it’s extremely pay to win, but it’s doable without money if you put in the time. All upgrades are locked by time constraints and resource amounts.

                    Way too expensive and much too long upgrades. Clash is a wonderful game but it is plagued with non-game nuisances like upgrade timers and artificial length. 
                    The game could be about playing it, but it becomes just about waiting for upgrades to finish 95% of the time. The solution Clash of Clans introduced from the beginning, 
                    I believe, is still just spend money to speed things up. If I wanted to catch up to another player that has been playing longer than me, I would need to spend hundreds of dollars, 
                    maybe even thousands, to speed up something that could be a click of a button. The game isn’t even about raiding to get enough gold or elixir, it’s about playing for a day in between 
                    a 3-7 day window while you wait for your town to build up instead of playing the game 3-7 days to earn enough resources to upgrade your buildings. The involvement with clan wars and 
                    I guess the rank system are the only things you could consider to be daily playable progress, and you are going to hit a level of base you can’t make progress on until your troops are 
                    high enough level eventually anyways. It’s just a shame that this could be a game I play instead of a game I look at. I shouldn’t be angry at a simple game but it’s hard not to when I 
                    look at it and can’t upgrade or progress for 5 days while my builders finish making my air defense do ~5-10% more damage maybe. The clan bases and daily incentives are cool but it doesn’t 
                    matter when you have full storage for a week and can’t do anything.

                    It’s good but a bad flaw. I love playing CoC because it’s fun and addicting, thus the rating, but because it’s not a 4-star or 5-star rating is because of Supercell banning me for no reason. 
                    The reason why they banned me was for my in-game name because it was inappropriate, which it wasn’t, but that’s not the point. They should just give you a warning or at least a month ban instead 
                    of banning you for life. I spent a lot of money on the game but they said I violated the terms of service but they should have just warned me first instead of banning me for life. This is a mobile
                    game it should never be that serious and there are people who have names that I can’t even say because of how bad they are but they won’t ban them at all. Supercell you have a good game just don’t
                    make it where you ban people for little things like this at least give a warning. This is why it’s a 3-star instead of 5.

                    making the game less enjoyable because I have to wait to play. But the game itself is awesome, the graphics are good, the gameplay is nice, and I really enjoy playing it.
                    I just wish the upgrade times were a bit shorter.

                    Very Attractive Game I enjoy this game for many of its functions. I enjoy the battling without all the gore, so it can be played with people who are conscious of these things. 
                    It has a ‘Join Clans’ and a ‘Add Friends’ function if you want to play with family members and friends, or make new ones. It has an original layout far different from most games, 
                    that is fun to play. The only things that are negative about this game is the wait time, how all the sceneries, magic items and perks have to be bought with real currency and not 
                    in game gems and the ‘Clan War’ function. If the wait time for everything was cut in half people would be able to play without one hour to three day waiting periods which would cause 
                    people to play for longer periods of time. If the sceneries, perks, magic items, e.t.c, were able to be bought with gems, players would have more freedom in purchase options. Lastly, 
                    if players could have infinite ‘Attack’ options people would be even more attracted to the game since they wouldn’t have to wait for the war to end. Other than those obstacles, this game 
                    has comical graphics, a little bit of strategy and fantasy creatures with both great styles and different attacks. Once the obstacles are fixed I believe that this game will receive a lot 
                    of better ratings from old-time players and new ones.

                    Game is fun, but needs improvements Hey guys, hopefully this review will make it to the supercell team. I have played this game for awhile and as a player I’ve noticed the dificulteis it is to climb to the top. 
                    To start with I want to talk about upgrading the walls. I’m at a point where my next walls upgrade will be 4mil per wall. This seems very unbalanced compared to what it costs to upgrade the buildings. I do want 
                    to say tho, thank you supercell team for coming out with the magic books!!! I just couldn’t bear the idea of waiting a month for a TH upgrade! Anyhow, the walls, way too expensive to upgrade, 4mil for a single piece 
                    of wall when a defense building costs only about twice as that, “maybe a way to add a less expensive way to upgrade the walls if you choose to let your builder work on it for awhile? Just an idea!” Many players have 
                    very rushed walls and it seems like a general issue.
